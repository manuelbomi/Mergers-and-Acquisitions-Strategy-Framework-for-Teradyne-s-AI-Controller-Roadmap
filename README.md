# Mergers & Acquisitions Strategy Framework for Teradyne’s AI Controller Roadmap

### Executive Summary

#### Why M & A Matters for Teradyne's AI Strategy

<ins>The Strategic Imperative</ins>

#### Instead of building every AI capability from scratch (which takes 2-3 years), Teradyne can acquire companies that already have:

- Proven AI algorithms for semiconductor test

- Established customer relationships in target markets

- Specialized talent in machine learning for manufacturing

- Complementary software platforms

<ins>Recent Example: Teradyne's Acquisition of LTE</ins>
In recent years, Teradyne acquired LitePoint, MiR and Quantifi Photonics. These are strategic acquisitions that immediately gave Teradyne good leverages in the domain of expertise of these acquisitions.

## Summary 

#### M & A is the fastest lever for Teradyne to acquire production-grade AI capabilities, specialized algorithms, and domain talent — typically saving 18–36 months of internal development time.

#### The scoring framework converts qualitative assessments into auditable, repeatable scores that can be used across deal teams and investment committees.

#### The valuation model ties growth and profitability to recommended offers and shows how negotiation levers (multiples, premiums) change valuations.

#### Technology gap analysis highlights the highest-value acquisition targets where time-to-market advantage is greatest (core ML infra, edge compute).

#### The partnership vs acquisition decision framework ensures strategic alignment and avoids overpaying for capabilities that can be licensed or co-developed.
